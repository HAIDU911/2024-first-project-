Here's an explanation of the code:

Library Management System

This is a C++ program that implements a simple library management system. The system allows users to perform various operations such as adding books, displaying books, searching for books, borrowing books, returning books, and more.

Functions

The program consists of several functions that perform specific tasks:

1. addBook(): Adds a new book to the library.
2. displayBooks(): Displays all books in the library.
3. searchBook(): Searches for a book by ID.
4. borrowBook(): Allows a user to borrow a book.
5. returnBook(): Allows a user to return a borrowed book.
6. viewBorrowedBooks(): Displays all borrowed books.
7. updateBook(): Updates the details of a book.
8. deleteBooks(): Deletes a book from the library.
9. sortBooks(): Sorts books in ascending order by title.
10. countBooks(): Displays the total number of books and borrowed books.
11. clearscreen(): Clears the screen.
12. loadBooks(): Loads books from a file.
13. saveBooks(): Saves books to a file.
14. filterString(): Filters a string to retain only numeric characters.
15. filterString2(): Filters a string to retain only alphabetic characters and spaces.

Main Function

The main() function is the entry point of the program. It:

1. Creates an instance of the library.
2. Loads books from a file.
3. Displays the main menu.
4. Enters a loop where it continuously prompts the user to enter a choice.
5. Based on the user's choice, it calls the corresponding function.

Data Structures

The program uses several arrays to store book details:

1. bookIDs: an array to store book IDs.
2. titles: an array to store book titles.
3. authors: an array to store book authors.
4. borrowedBy: an array to store the names of borrowers.

The program also uses a constant MAX_BOOKS to define the maximum number of books that can be stored in the library.
